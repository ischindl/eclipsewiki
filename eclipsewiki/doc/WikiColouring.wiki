Syntax colouring in wiki is done with an IRule and RuleBasedScanner.
The wiki classes are:

* com.teaminabox.eclipse.wiki.editors.WikiScanner 
* implementations of com.teaminabox.eclipse.wiki.text.TextRegionMatcher

The scanner has a set of TextRegionMatchers added to its set of rules upon construction. The particular set of matchers depends on the renderer chosen by the user.
The editor gets the scanner through the WikiConfiguration: com.teaminabox.eclipse.wiki.editors.WikiConfiguration - see method public IPresentationReconciler getPresentationReconciler(ISourceViewer sourceViewer)

The method of interest for deciding upon colours is in the rule (TextRegionMatcher):

	 :	public IToken evaluate(ICharacterScanner scanner) 

The algorithm for each matcher depends on what it is matching but basically:
* Using the scanner, scan to an appropriate end marker (whitespace, end of line, end of document, etc) for the matcher
** The first character is tested so that the matcher fails fast. For example, if the first character is not a capital letter then the BasicWikiNameMatcher will terminate immediately. This was done to help improve performance.
* If the text obtained is a match then an appropriate IToken is returned. If it isn't a match then IToken.UNDEFINED is returned.

Thats all there is to it.
